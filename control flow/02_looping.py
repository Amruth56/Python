# Using enumerate():  enumerate() is used to loop through the containers printing the index number along with the value present in that particular index.

for key, value in enumerate (["hello", "world", "its", "a", "new", "day"]):
    print(key,value)
print("\n")

    print(key,end=" ")
print("\n")

for key, value in enumerate (["hello", "world", "its", "a", "new", "day"]):
    print(value,end=" ")

    # Using zip(): zip() is used to combine 2 similar containers(list-list or dict-dict) printing the values sequentially. The loop exists only till the smaller container ends. 

que = ["name", "age", "native place", "gender"]
ans = ["Amruth", 20, "Kodagu", "Male"]

for q , a in zip (que, ans):
    print(f"what is your {q}? My {q} is= {a}")

# Using sorted():  sorted() is used to print the container is sorted order. It doesnâ€™t sort the container but just prints the container in sorted order for 1 instance. The use of set() can be combined to remove duplicate occurrences.
